<!-- Before you open an issue: Have you checked the troubleshooting section? Have you used a search engine to search for your specific problem? It might not be related to this project. Also check that you are not reporting your problem in a kind of XY-problem style: https://www.perlmonks.org/?node=XY+Problem -->

<!-- Note that this is a student project and I plan to fix issues, but only from time to time. Please don't be disappointed if you have to wait several weeks to get a response back from me. If this is too long for you, you might also try to fix the bug on your own and submit a pull request. -->

**Description**
<!-- A clear and concise description of the bug. In the very best case (optionally), you've already done some research and maybe even figured out what is broken, e.g. did not include a vendor prefix for a stylesheet in the browser etc. -->

<!-- Please include screenshots to help explain your problem if applicable -->

**Reproduce**
<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior. -->

**Expected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. The more concise, the less we have to play question-answer-ping-pong. -->

**System**
<!-- Make sure to include version information about your system environment, e.g. your Raspberry Pi distribution and version, your browser version and OS from which you try to access the WiFi network.-->
